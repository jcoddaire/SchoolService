# School Service

This is a simple demo project. It includes things I'm learning, practicing, or iterating on. Feel free to check it out.

## Current Technologies:

- WebAPI
- Entity Framework
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Microsoft SQL Server 2014

## To Add:

- Front end client / web app. Probably going to be using Angular or React, haven't decided which yet.
- Examples for newer tech - .NET Core is interesting.
- Examples for older tech - DataTables, ASMX services, etc.
- The auto-build thing I see on OSS projects.

## To Iterate:

### WebAPI

- Add authorization.
- Add global error handling.
- Add logging. I'll have to investigate what free options exist.

### Entity Framework

- Add environments - Dev, Cert, Prod.
- Add logging. I'll have to investigate what free options exist.

### Tests (Unit, Integration)

- Add environments.
